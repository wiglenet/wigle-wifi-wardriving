Release notes: https://github.com/wiglenet/wigle-wifi-wardriving/blob/master/TODO

For WiFi and cell towers to be mapped, you must wait for your device to determine the current location, via GPS or network location.
On map: the circles are WiFi, squares are cell towers. Light colors are networks seen before, purple ones are new for the local database.
If you have trouble logging in, or have suggestions, send us an email to wigle-admin@wigle.net and we'll be happy to help out.
Needs "Reads Phone State" in order to tell if a phone call is in progress, to mute the audio (sounds and speech).
Files are available to help with a human translation to non-English languages. This was mostly a mechanical translation, because we obviously don't know all these languages. You can help to improve things by making pull requests at:

or sending them to wigle-admin@wigle.net.

Keep on stumbling!
